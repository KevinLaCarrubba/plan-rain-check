# plan-rain-check

This is our project Night(out?). We hope to help dinners decide which restaurants or activities are right for them and show them the weather for that night. In order to achieve that, our group utlized both the Yelp and Weather API to fetch the information we needed. On our landing page, the user can enter any city into our search bar, and the website will display the top 5 choices of activities in that city. On the nav bar, the users are provided with the option to check the current weather. It will tell the user the current temperature, wind speed, UV index, and the current condition. On the restaurants and activities display, the user will see the addresses, phone numbers and a link to the respective Yelp page in case the user wants more information. Overall, we hope to deliever the users a tool to utilize when they are deciding to have a night out.
